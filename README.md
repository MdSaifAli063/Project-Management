# Project Camp

Backend API and static frontend for a simple project management app.

## Overview

This repository contains an Express + MongoDB backend (API) and a small static frontend served from `public/`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- MongoDB accessible via a connection string

## Required environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with at least the following values:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/projectcamp
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret_here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret_here
# SMTP settings (optional, for email):
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=you@example.com
SMTP_PASS=yourpassword
```

## Install and run

```powershell
cd D:\project-management
npm install
npm run dev   # runs with nodemon
# or: npm start
```

The backend serves the static frontend from `public/` by default. Open:

- http://localhost:5000/
- http://localhost:5000/login.html
- http://localhost:5000/dashboard.html

## Frontend

The frontend is a set of static HTML/JS pages in `public/`. It communicates with the API under `/api/v1/`.

Token storage: the frontend stores access tokens in `localStorage` under key `pc_access` and sends them as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## File uploads

Uploaded files are stored in `public/images/uploads`. The server creates this directory automatically on startup.

## Troubleshooting

- CORS: set `CLIENT_URL` to the origin you use for the frontend (e.g. `http://localhost:5173` or include multiple origins comma-separated).
- Email: if you don't configure SMTP, email verification links will not be sent — use the backend endpoints to simulate verification or inspect tokens in the DB.
- If you see `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors, check the require/import paths under `src/` and ensure files exist.

## Next steps / Improvements

- Replace static frontend with a React/Vite SPA for a better developer experience.
- Harden CSP for production (use `helmet`).
- Add tests and a CI workflow.
